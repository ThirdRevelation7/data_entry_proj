# Data Entry Automation Project
* Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a Zillow clone website for monthly rent, addresses, and links to all available properties in a specified area.
* Then uses Selenium webdriver to fill out multiple responses to a linked Google Form with all the scraped data.
* You can then, with one click, turn all responses into a Google Sheet with every rental cost, address and link to the property cleanly organized into separate columns.
